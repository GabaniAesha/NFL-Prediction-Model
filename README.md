# NFL-Prediction-Model


# Overview
This project develops a predictive model for NFL games, leveraging historical game data to forecast game outcomes. By analyzing various factors such as team performance, game schedules, and historical scores, we aim to provide insights into future games, enhancing the accuracy of game predictions.

# Key Components
Python Analysis Script (nfltest2final.py): Utilizes data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict NFL game outcomes. The script incorporates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and the application of several machine learning classifiers.

Data Dictionary (datadictionary.md): A comprehensive guide to the dataset used in the model, detailing the structure and description of each column. Essential for understanding the dataset's nuances and how it informs the predictive model.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis, ensuring quality and consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing and examining the data to uncover patterns and insights.

Predictive Modeling: Applying various machine learning algorithms to predict the outcomes of NFL games.

Performance Evaluation: Assessing the accuracy of the models through metrics such as ROC-AUC scores and Brier score loss.
